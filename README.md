Playwright Automation Project

This project is an end-to-end automation framework built using Playwright in Python with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It supports cross-browser testing and ensures modular and scalable automation.

Key Features

Implements the Page Object Model (POM) for improved code maintainability.

Supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Integrated with pytest for organized test execution and reporting.

Uses pytest-playwright for enhanced Playwright integration.

Follows a modular folder structure for scalability.

Project Overview

The project is designed to ensure efficient automation by separating page elements, test cases, and utility functions. The use of POM simplifies maintenance by isolating web element locators and actions from test logic. Cross-browser support ensures better test coverage across multiple environments.

Usage

Tests are executed using pytest with browser options.

Environment variables manage sensitive data such as URLs and credentials.

Fixtures are implemented in conftest.py to improve reusability and reduce redundancy.

Best Practices

Follow the Page Object Model for organized automation.

Maintain descriptive test names for clarity.

Use fixtures and hooks to improve code efficiency and modularization.

Reporting

Test reports can be generated for better visibility into execution results, ensuring effective debugging and analysis.
